Feature: We can create a new book project and build books
  We need to be able to create a new book project so we can manage
  the book's content/layout in one place and then convert it into many
  different types of print and/or (e)Books.

  Scenario: Create a new book project
    When I successfully run `bookshop new test_book`
    Then the output should contain "config/book.yml"
    When I cd to "test_book"
    Then the following files should exist:
    | book/book.html.erb |
    | book/assets/images/canvas.jpg |
    | book/frontmatter/toc.html.erb |
    | config/book.yml |
    | README.rdoc |
    | script/bookshop |
    And the following directories should exist:
    | builds/epub |
    | builds/html |
    | builds/pdf |
    | builds/mobi |
