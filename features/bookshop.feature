Feature: We can create a new book project and build books
	We need to be able to create a new book project so we can manage
	the book's content/layout in one place and then convert it into many
	different types of print and/or (e)Books.
		
	Scenario: Create a new book project
		When I successfully run `bookshop new test_book`
		Then the output should contain "config/book.yml"
		When I cd to "test_book"
		Then the following files should exist:
		| book/book.html.erb |
		| book/assets/images/canvas.jpg |
		| book/frontmatter/toc.html.erb |
		| config/book.yml |
		| README.rdoc |
		| script/bookshop |
		| script/epubcheck/epubcheck.jar |

		| script/epubcheck/lib/saxon.jar |
		And the following directories should exist:
		| builds/epub |
		| builds/html |
